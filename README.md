This dashboard is a visual learning tool that allows users to observe how changing various parameters influences the performance of a 4-cylinder internal combustion engine.

The simulation continuously updates as the slider values are changed to increase or decrease factors such as:

  -Injection timing
  -Air to fuel ratio
  -Pressure
  -Throttle levels

The code then uses the user input data from the sliders to simulate the engine with those parameters. It then plots the changes in cylinder pressure vs crank angle and volume and calculate engine performance factors such as:

  -Horsepower
  -Adiabatic Heat Release
  -Efficiency
  -Air-to-Fuel Ratio

Simply run the file and adjust the sliders to match your test parameters to get an overview of the engine simulation with those inputs.
